Robot era has grown incredibly within the previous couple of years.

Such invention Turned into only a dream for a few human beings a few years ago. But on this speedy transferring world, there may be now a need for a robot like “A Human Following Robot” that can work together and exist.

The improvement of robot generation has Significantly elevated due to industrial, scientific, and military applications. In diverse Sectors with hard terrain together with underground mines, navy bases, scientific, Creation, exploration etc. man-made paintings may be very risky. The lives of helpers also are at stake.

Human sports have their limits in many methods. Which will see past Human obstacles in imaginative and prescient, pace, consistency, flexibility, high-quality and so on. 
We need to use robots. A key requirement for these robots is their capacity to look people and to communicate in a non-technical manner. The primary cause of this dissertation is to make a robot that could assist humans with numerous responsibilities. In this paper, we introduce the prototype of a human-guided robot that makes use of Arduino Uno and diverse sensors to detect and tune an item.
